        <h6><b>Investigation of Pd/TiO2/Si MIS capacitor as Hydrogen Sensor</b></h6>
        <p>Purpose – The present study investigates the gas sensing capability of Pd/TiO2/Si MIS capacitor using capacitance versus gate voltage (C-V) response as a function of hydrogen gas concentration varying from 0.1 ppm to 2 ppm at 300 kHz frequency. 
Design/methodology/approach – The objective is to fabricated a MIS capacitor sensor based on TiO2 ¬thin film insulator deposited by sol-gel spin coating process. Gas sensing signal derived on exposure to hydrogen with concentration varying from 0.1 ppm to 2 ppm at different operating temperatures (room temperature to 1500C) was measured as variation in flat-band voltage in C-V characteristics of the MIS capacitor. 
Findings – High sensitivity of the sensor is attributed to the large change of interface state charges because of the large surface to volume ratio of the nano-structured TiO2. The values of response time as well as the recovery time have also been estimated and are found to be comparable to that observed in the case of conventional MOS structure.
Research limitations/implications – The use of Si substrate restricts the performance of gas sensors to 2000C as the Si substrate begins to show conductive nature.</p>
