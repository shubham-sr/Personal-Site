        <h5><b>Investigation of Pd/TiO2/Si MIS capacitor as Hydrogen Sensor</b></h5>

        <p1>Purpose – The present study investigates the gas sensing capability of Pd/TiO2/Si MIS capacitor using capacitance versus gate voltage (C-V) response as a function of hydrogen gas concentration varying from 0.1 ppm to 2 ppm at 300 kHz frequency. 
Design/methodology/approach – The objective is to fabricated a MIS capacitor sensor based on TiO2 ¬thin film insulator deposited by sol-gel spin coating process. Gas sensing signal derived on exposure to hydrogen with concentration varying from 0.1 ppm to 2 ppm at different operating temperatures (room temperature to 1500C) was measured as variation in flat-band voltage in C-V characteristics of the MIS capacitor. 
Findings – High sensitivity of the sensor is attributed to the large change of interface state charges because of the large surface to volume ratio of the nano-structured TiO2. The values of response time as well as the recovery time have also been estimated and are found to be comparable to that observed in the case of conventional MOS structure.
Research limitations/implications – The use of Si substrate restricts the performance of gas sensors to 2000C as the Si substrate begins to show conductive nature.</p1>

 <h5><b>Study the Target effect on the Structural, Surface and Optical properties of TiO2 Thin Film Fabricated by RF Sputtering Method</b></h5>
      <p1>The effect of target (Ti metal target and TiO2 target) on Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) thin films grown on ITO coated glass substrate by RF magnetron sputtering has been investigated. A comparative study of both the films was done in respect of crystalline structure, surface morphology and optical properties by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) studies and ellipsometric measurements. The XRD results confirmed the crystalline structure and indicated that the deposited films have the intensities of anatase phase. The surface morphology and roughness values indicated that the film using Ti metal target has a smoother surface and densely packed with grains as compared to films obtained using TiO2 target. A high transmission in the visible region, and direct band gap of 3.67 eV and 3.75 eV for films derived by using Ti metal and TiO2 target respectively and indirect bandgap of 3.39 eV for the films derived from both the targets (Ti metal and TiO2 target) were observed by the ellipsometric measurements.</p1>      <!-- Generate such a widget at snapwidget.com for your name -->

    <h6>Fabrication and Characterization of Metal/Insulator/Semiconductor Structures Based on TiO2 and TiO2/SiO2 Thin Films Prepared by Low-Temperature Arc Vapor Deposition</h6>
        <p>The present work involves the fabrication and characterization of two different metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) structures: Pd/TiO2/Si and Pd/TiO2/SiO2/Si. The TiO2 thin films on the n-type Si <100> substrate were deposited using low-temperature arc vapor deposition process. The electrical characterizations of MIS structures were investigated using capacitance-voltage and current density-voltage measurements. The effects of annealing on the properties of the films were also studied. Furthermore, the structural, surface morphological and electrical properties of the devices were compared with those obtained using other deposition techniques.</p>
